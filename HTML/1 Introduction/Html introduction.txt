HTML Introduction
-----------------
1. Fullform of HTML is HyperText Markup language.
where hypertext means text which contains link to another text.
and markup language means tag <> based language.

Markup language works on three terminology : 
    a. Definition : Every tag have some specific definition
    b. Processing : Every tag performs processing according to its definition
    c. Presentation : At the end, tag display its content accordingly

2. Html document contains multimedia content (audio, video, animation, images, transition, transformation etc)

3. We can create html document on any word processing tool(notepad, wordpad) or on any editor(vs code, sublime text, dreamviewer) or on any IDE(NetBeans, Ecllipse) etc.

4. Output of Html document is going to be displayed out on browser screen.

5. We need to save html document by .html or by .htm extension.

6. Html also works on three terminology : 
    i.  Tag
    ii. Attribute
    iii.Element

    i.  Tag : Tags are the hidden keywords, which are mainly used to display content on output screen.
    Types of tags : 
        a. Empty Tag (UnBalanced Tag)
           only opening and no closing
           ex : <br>, <hr>, <img> etc 

        b. Container Tag (Balanced Tag)
           opening and closing both
           ex : <html></html>, <div></div> etc

        c. Semantic Tag
           Tag which shows its meaning by its name or where content is going to be displayed out on browser screen
           ex : <header></header>, <footer></footer> etc

        d. Non-Sementic Tag (Structural Tag)
           Generalized tag 
           ex : <div></div>, <form></form> etc

        e. Self closing Tag 
           ex : <br/>,<input/> etc

    ii. Attribute : Attribute provides some additional information
    <p>.............</p>
    <p align="center">.................</p>

    <img src="" height="" width="">

    here align, src, height, and width are attributes, which simply provides some additional information.
     
    iii.Element
    HTML is an element which represents whole body and it comprises of opening of <html> tag and closing of </html> tag.
    Similarly, Body is also an element, which represents documents body and it comprises of opening of <body> tag and closing of </body> tag.

History : 
---------
HTML was developed by Tim Berner's Lee(CERN RESEARCHER) in 1980's simply for sharing documents with his co-workers.But later on in 1991, he decided to brought html in web designing with few tags. Currently HTML5 is going in the market.

Structure of HTML : 
-------------------
<!DOCTYPE html> 
here <! = MDO (Markup Declaration Open)
     <!--  --> = also used in commenting

     DOCTYPE = Documentation Type 
     Doctype simply represents that which type of documentation, browser needs to expect with this coming html document.

<html>            represents html document
   <head>         head portion, includes links, styles and title etc
      <title>     it simply represents the title of the page on title bar 
         Home Page
      </title>
   </head>
   <body>         represents document's body
      <div></div>
      <span></span>
